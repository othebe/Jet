High:

*- LEDs need to be the correct color.

*- It needs to be possible to delete items

*- Only one of each component is allowed. (DONE)
*- DEVON BUG: Renaming does not work. You probably don't want to delete, gadgetModel:154 - this.components[old_name] = this.components[new_name]; is probably null.
*- Also the changes to the name shouldn't change references to the ComponentInstance to avoid breaking listeners.

*- components with multiple placed parts are not yet tested.

*- Components cannot exend off the edge of the board.

*- Zoom only affects components, not board. (DONE)

*- WHen zoomed in, some portions of the board are not reachable. (DONE)

*- The catalog doesn't look very good. it needs to be formatted better.

- too much precision for translations and rotations

- Some kind of material design alterative to the menus.

- Why does changing perspectives take so long?  Is it re-loading the catalog?

- Why does reading the catalog take so long?  Could we do it in the background?

*- Zooming should be centered on the center of the gadget. (Verify)

- Geometry for rotations need to consider REAL center x and y's.
  . Have real X and Y that is passed to GSPEC.

- Gadget explorer needs to have board selectable to set board dimensions.

- Replace SVG name w/Fabric image.

- Snap to grid doesn't work.

Low:
- Isolate scopes on directives. (DONE)

- Add SVG resizer to Grunt/Makefile (PhantomJS)
